Test the default-backend to be sure ingress-nginx-controller is installed correctly.

Normally after controller svc you will get an external for access(cloud based env),
here we are on the VMs, so we manually set the external access IP in controller svc yml.
```
  externalIPs:
  - 192.168.0.43
```

You will notice the EXTERNAL-IP will be assigned, not _pending_
```
root@node3:/media# kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
default-http-backend   ClusterIP      10.105.172.33   <none>         80/TCP                       50m
ingress-nginx          LoadBalancer   10.106.24.26    192.168.0.43   80:30816/TCP,443:30619/TCP   56m
```


ip is node IP `192.168.0.45` or k8s cluster ip `192.168.0.43`

```
