# create secret for SSL, TLS
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx#conventions

Anytime we reference a tls secret, we mean (x509, pem encoded, RSA 2048, etc). You can generate such a certificate with:
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ${KEY_FILE} -out ${CERT_FILE} -subj "/CN=${HOST}/O=${HOST}"
```
and create the kubernetes.io/tls type secret via
```
kubectl create secret tls ${CERT_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE}
```

[A concrete example to create secret](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tls#tls-certificate-termination)
Be sure type is `kubernetes.io/tls`.
```
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/cafe.key -out  /etc/ssl/certs/cafe.crt -subj "/CN=cafe.example.com/O=cafe.example.com"
$ kubectl create secret tls default-server-secret --key  /etc/ssl/private/cafe.key --cert /etc/ssl/certs/cafe.crt

$kubectl get secrets
NAME                    TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
default-server-secret   kubernetes.io/tls                     2         24m
default-token-t98hc     kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3         1d
```

# create dhparam.pem
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-on-centos-7

While we are using OpenSSL, we should also create a strong Diffie-Hellman group, which is used in negotiating Perfect Forward Secrecy with clients.

We can do this by typing:
```
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
```
This may take a few minutes, but when it's done you will have a strong DH group at /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem that we can use in our configuration.

# side knowledge FQDN
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/cafe.key -out  /etc/ssl/certs/cafe.crt
```

Fill out the prompts appropriately. The most important line is the one that requests the Common Name (e.g. your fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or YOUR name). You need to enter the domain name associated with your server or your server's public IP address.

For example, an FQDN for a hypothetical mail server might be `mymail.somecollege.edu`. The hostname is `mymail`, and the host is located within the domain `somecollege.edu`.

The entirety of the prompts will look something like this:

Output
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:New York
Locality Name (eg, city) []:New York City
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Bouncy Castles, Inc.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Ministry of Water Slides
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:server_IP_address
Email Address []:admin@your_domain.com
```
