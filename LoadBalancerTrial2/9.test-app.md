To test app, you need to be sure app pod is running.
Sometimes pod didn't start, try to give at least 2G mem to single node case or 1G for two nodes case.
Try to restart nodes as well as the k8s cluster master.
```
root@node3:~# kubectl get po
NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coffee-rc-754464f4bf-56s8g                 1/1       Running   1          8m
coffee-rc-754464f4bf-8l7fb                 1/1       Running   1          8m

Trick for DNS, add a record to bypass public DNS server for your website.
Edit file `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host` for win10 or `/etc/hosts` for Linux
In case you need to flush dns `ipconfig /flushdns` for win10.
```
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost

192.168.0.43	cafe.example.com
```
cafe.example.com/healthz will display ok in Chrome browser.
cafe.example.com/coffee will display the nginx logo and pod info.
cafe.example.com/dev will display the pod info, but currently not working!!!

Another issues, once above setup, `kubectl cluster-info` will no longer allows you for connections.
It looks like your website starts and blocks the cluster master, reboot cluster master will help.
```
root@node3:~# kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.0.43:6443

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
The connection to the server 192.168.0.43:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```
